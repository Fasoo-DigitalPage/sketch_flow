## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Use `sketch_flow`
### Install the package
- Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```dart
dependencies:
  sketch_flow: ^latest_version
```

### `SketchController` and `SketchBoard`
- SketchController is a key class that manages drawing data.  
By passing this controller to SketchBoard, you can process user input, extract or reload the information you need.
```dart
final SketchController _controller = SketchController();
```
- And if you want to extract images with PNG or save the screen, you need to set GlobalKey on SketchBoard.  
This key is internally connected to RepaintBoundary and is used to capture images.
