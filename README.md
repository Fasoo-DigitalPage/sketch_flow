## How to Use `sketch_flow`
#### Install the package
- Add this to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```dart
dependencies:
  sketch_flow: ^latest_version
```

#### `SketchController` and `SketchBoard`
- SketchController is a key class that manages drawing data.  
By passing this controller to SketchBoard, you can process user input, extract or reload the information you need.
```dart
final SketchController _controller = SketchController();
```

- And if you want to extract images with PNG or save the screen, you need to set GlobalKey on SketchBoard.  
This key is internally connected to RepaintBoundary and is used to capture images.
```dart
final GlobalKey _repaintKey = GlobalKey();
```

- After this definition, pass it along to `SketchBoard`:
```dart
SketchBoard(
  controller: _controller,
  repaintKey: _repaintKey,
)
```
#### (Optional) Use `SketchTopBar` and `SketchBottomBar`  
- It's easy to use, and you can customize it in your own style through a variety of parameters.
```dart
Scaffold(
  appBar: SketchTopBar(controller: _controller),
  body: SketchBoard(controller: _controller),
  bottomNavigationBar: SketchBottomBar(controller: _sketchController),
)
```
> ðŸ’¡ Of course, you can freely configure the UI.  
> If you connect the Sketch Controller properly, you can design the UI any way you want without the top and bottom bars.

## Export & Import Drawings
#### JSON (Serialization / Deserialization)
- You can easily **serialize (export)** your sketch data to JSON and **deserialize (import)** it back using the controller:
```dart
final json = _controller.toJson(); // Serialization

_controller.fromJson(json: json); // Deserialization
```
#### PNG
- You can easily export your drawing as a PNG using `SketchController`.  
Customize the image resolution with the `pixelRatio` parameter:
```dart
final Uint8List? image = await _controller.extractPNG(
  repaintKey: _repaintKey,
  pixelRatio: 2.0, // Customize resolution
);
```
#### SVG
- Easily export your drawing as an SVG with `SketchController`.  
You can define the canvas width and height to match your needs.
```dart
final String svgCode = await _controller.extractSVG(
  width: 300.0, // Define canvas width
  height: 400.0, // Define canvas height
);
```

## Tools Overview
| Tool Type   | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Move**    | Enables panning and zooming of the canvas without affecting the drawings.                        |
| **Pencil**  | Draws a continuous line based on user input. Configurable stroke thickness, color, and opacity.  |
| **Brush**   | Simulates a brush-like stroke with smooth edges. Supports color and thickness customization.     |
| **Palette** | Allows users to select colors for drawing tools. |
| **Eraser**  | Erases drawings either by stroke or by area.    |
